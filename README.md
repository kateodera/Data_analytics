# Electric vehicles charging stations distribution
Business Overview/Problem
PowerCharge Utilities encounters several critical challenges due to the growing adoption of electric vehicles:

A. Increased Load Demand: Widespread EV adoption has caused a significant spike in electricity demand, particularly during peak charging times. This strains the existing distribution network infrastructure.

B. Grid Overloads: Frequent overloads in the distribution network leads to voltage fluctuations and outages in specific areas, affecting overall grid reliability.

C. Customer Satisfaction: EV owners expect reliable and convenient charging services. Ensuring this level of service is essential to maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty.

D. Cost Management: Balancing increased load demands and grid reliability comes at a significant cost. PowerCharge Utilities must optimize network investments to manage expenses effectively.
 

Rationale for the Project
Distribution Network Analysis in the energy industry refers to the process of studying and evaluating the electrical distribution networks that deliver electricity from high-voltage transmission lines to end-users, such as homes, businesses, and industrial facilities. This analysis becomes even more critical with the rise of EVs, as it transforms the energy landscape. 

Top Five Reasons for the Project's Significance:
 

A. Customer Retention: Maintaining a reliable EV charging experience is essential for retaining existing customers who have embraced EVs.
 
B. Revenue Growth: Accommodating the growing demand for EV charging services opens new revenue streams and capitalizes on the expanding EV market.
 
C. Sustainability Goals: Supporting EVs aligns with the company's sustainability objectives, contributing to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
 
D. Regulatory Compliance: Meeting regulatory standards for grid reliability and capacity planning is vital to avoid penalties and ensure operational excellence.
 
E. Technological Innovation: Embracing data analytics empowers PowerCharge Utilities to stay at the forefront of technological innovation in the energy sector.
Aim of the Project
The project aims to achieve the following objectives:

A. Assess Network Capacity: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the distribution network's current capacity to handle increased load from EV charging stations.

B. Identify Bottlenecks: Identify potential bottlenecks and vulnerabilities within the distribution network that could hinder reliable electricity delivery to EV charging stations.

C. Optimize Network Upgrades: Develop a data-driven strategy for network upgrades that maximizes efficiency, minimizes costs, and ensures grid reliability.
